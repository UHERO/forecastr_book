# About

This document describes some useful practices for using R for applied research, especially in the time series and forecasting domain. It also serves as a guide for contributors to the `forecastr` R project. The focus of the project is forecasting using multi-equation behavioral models. The project encompasses data preparation, model selection (work in progress), external forecast generation, local forecast generation (work in progress), simulations (work in progress), and forecast distribution to a more granular scale.
