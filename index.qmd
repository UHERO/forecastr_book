# About

This document describes some useful practices for using R for applied research, especially in the time series and forecasting domain. It also serves as a guide for contributors to the `forecastr` R project. The focus of the project is forecasting using multi-equation behavioral models. The project encompasses data preparation, model selection (work in progress), external forecast generation, local forecast generation (planned), simulations (planned), and forecast distribution to a more granular scale.

[Chapters @sec-projects] - [-@sec-renv] discuss the general setup of a collaborative project environment under version control. [Chapter @sec-setup] deals with the setup file that configures the most general aspects of the `forecastr` project. [Chapter @sec-utils] describes useful functions for time series manipulation and forecasting. [Chapter @sec-bestpract] gives examples of best practices for time series manipulation. [Chapter @sec-modselect] describes a forecasting workflow from model selection to simulation.
