# Resources for time series modeling with R

## Project setup

Coding Conventions in R:

Basic ideas for a reproducible workflow: 

Set up your work in projects:
https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html

Read section I in WTF:
https://rstats.wtf/save-source.html

A good list of consideration for structuring projects:
https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/08/structuring-r-projects/

Use RStudio projects with sub-directories

-   R - R code.
-   data/raw - data external to the project.
-   data/processed - intermediate processed data.
-   notes - Rmd, and Rmd output, notes, papers, supporting documents, Rmd, etc.
-   output - reports, tables, etc.
-   output/plots - plots.
-   renv - used for library management (don't edit).
-   man - help files (don't edit).

Preference settings:


Follow the tidyverse style guide:
https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html

Not to self: look at the targets package for workflow automation
https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/index.html

Render results from R scripts via Rmd:
1) source your R code from within Rmd
2) only render important results in Rmd chunks

R Best Practices by Krista L. DeStasio: https://kdestasio.github.io/post/r_best_practices/  

Use here() from the here package to write file paths 

Suppose you have a dataset in csv format. Use readr::read_csv(here::here("The subfolder where your csv file resides", "The CSV file.csv"))

Do not use setwd() and rm(list = ls())

Do not save the workspace to the .Rdta file

Use library() not require()

Use version control (useful for recording changes between different versions of a file over time - see below for Git integration)

Use block letters for R file names (because the NAS file server is case sensitive)

Evaluate the R packages: gets, ARDL, etc.

The gets package is used for Multi-path General-to-Specific (GETS) modelling of the mean and/or variance of a regression, and Indicator Saturation (ISAT) methods for detecting structural breaks in the mean.https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gets/index.html

 The ARDL package creates complex autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models providing just the order and automatically constructs the underlying unrestricted and restricted error correction model (ECM). It also performs the bounds-test for cointegration as described in Pesaran et al. (2001). https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ARDL/index.html https://github.com/Natsiopoulos/ARDL 

Tidy tools for time series modeling under tidyverts: https://tidyverts.org  - The fable package applies tidyverse principles to time series modeling used for forecasting: https://fable.tidyverts.org/ - The tsibble package provides a tidy data structure for time series: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsibble/index.html - The tsibbledata package provide a different types of datasets in the tsibble data structure: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsibbledata/index.html - The tsibbletalk package introduces shared key to the tsibble, to easily {crosstalk} between plots on both client and server sides (i.e. with or without shiny): https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tsibbletalk/tsibbletalk.pdf- The feasts package provides a collection of features, decomposition methods, statistical summaries and graphics functions for the analysing tidy time series data: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/feasts/index.html - The fable.prohphet package provides an interface allowing the prophet forecasting procedure to be used within the fable framework: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fable.prophet/vignettes/intro.html 

The xts or Extensible Time Series package provides an extensible time series class, enabling uniform handling of many R time series classes : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html xts: Extensible Time Series: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/vignettes/xts.pdf

Think about dummies, breaks, outliers 

Figure out how bimets deals with ragged edge, add-factors, goal search

The bimets is an R package developed with the aim of easing time series analysis and building up a framework that facilitates the definition, estimation and simulation of simultaneous equation models: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bimets/index.htmlbimets - Time Series And Econometric Modeling In R: https://github.com/cran/bimets https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bimets/vignettes/bimets.pdf
