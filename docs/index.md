# About

This document describes the setup and components of the `forecastr` project. The focus of the project is forecasting using multi-equation behavioral models. The project encompasses data preparation, model selection (work in progress), external forecast generation, local forecast generation (planned), simulations (planned), and forecast distribution to a more granular scale.

## Usage

Chapters 2-3 discuss the general setup of a collaborative project under version control. Chapter 4 deals with the setup file that configures the most general aspects of the `forecastr` project. Chapter 5 describes user defined helper functions for the `forecastr` project. Chapter 6 gives examples of best practices for time series manipulation.
